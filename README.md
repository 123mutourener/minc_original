# Material Segmentation code git repo

The original paper, Material Recognition in the Wild with the Materials in Context Database, is not possible to reimplement. The first reason is that, the segments for training is not included in the database. The second reason is that, the patch classification accuracy is lower than reported (85% and 81%). Therefore, this project is currently abandoned.
